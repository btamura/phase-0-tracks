    <h1>Hello Planet E-Arth</h1>
    <h2>I like dogs more than cats!</h2>
        <p>
            I like <strong>dogs</strong> more than cats because I'm allergic to cats and I think cats are too independent.  I know when I come home from work my dog will show me affection.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm seeing what is <em>"em" element </em>does in my HTML page. I think it makes my text <em>italicized</em>?
        </p>
    <h3>Here is a <strong> list of what I don't like about cats:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I think cats are temperamental.  They will scratch you out of no where.</li>
            <li>Again I'm also <strong>allergic</strong> to the feline creatures</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Here is a list of what I <strong>LOVE</strong> about dogs:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dog are super playful</li>
            <li>Dogs help me get out of the house</li>
            <li>Dogs are a great way of meeting new people in NYC. <strong>DOG WALKER=Social Magnet</strong></li>
        </ol>
